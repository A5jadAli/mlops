1. Create a git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create mycode.py file and add code to it. (it will save the csv file to a new 'data' folder)
3. Do a git add/commit/push before initializing dvc.
4. Do 'dvc init' to initialize dvc that will create (.dvc folder and .dvcignore file)
5. Now make a folder of any name. Let's say S3
6. Now do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Now do "dvc add data/"   -> you will get an error here because intially we were tracking data/ from git but now we want to do it with DVC
8. Now "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
9. Now do a git add/commit/push to mark this stage as 1st version of data
10. Now make changes to mycode.py file to append a new row in data and check changes via "dvc status"
11. Again "dvc commit" and "dvc push"
12. Now again do a git add/commit/push to mark this stage as 2nd version of data
13. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date
14. Now repear step 10-12 for V3 of data


Now:
git log --oneline
git checkout <hash> - git checkout main
dvc pull
