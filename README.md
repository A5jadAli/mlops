## Introduction

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of streamlining and automating the lifecycle of machine learning models, from development to production. This repository will guide you through setting up an MLOps pipeline that includes version control, modular programming, data versioning, and cloud-based deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- DVC (Data Version Control)
- AWS CLI (for interacting with AWS S3)

You should also have a basic understanding of Python programming, machine learning concepts, and cloud services.

## Getting Started with Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are essential tools for version control in MLOps. Here's what you'll learn:

- Setting up Git in your local environment
- Creating a GitHub repository
- Understanding branches and merging
- Best practices for commit messages and pull requests

## Python Modular Programming for MLOps

Modular programming is key to maintaining and scaling machine learning code. This section covers:

- Creating Python modules and packages
- Writing reusable functions and classes
- Organizing code for clarity and maintainability

## Data Versioning with DVC

Data Version Control (DVC) is a tool that allows you to version control large datasets and models. In this section, you'll learn:

- Setting up DVC in your project
- Tracking data and models with DVC
- Integrating DVC with Git
- Managing data storage with AWS S3

## Building an End-to-End Pipeline with DVC and AWS S3

This section will guide you through building a complete MLOps pipeline:

- Setting up AWS S3 for data storage
- Creating a DVC pipeline to automate data processing and model training
- Configuring continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for your ML models
- Monitoring and updating models in production
